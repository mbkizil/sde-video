# ONGOING:
- Experiment for video as stochastic process: bm and fbm experiments
    - The problem was related to cuda cudnn version mismatch. By IT, new versions are available in cluster
    - Experiments are ongoing now but will be finished in a weeek.

# TO DO:
- diffusion process 
    - Stable diffusion
    - Invert in a dataset (pick a movement e.g. right arm up in tai-chi), invert only involves this movement
    - Focus on reconstruction quality
